				<p>UXCamp London is a BarCamp focused on exploring user experience, where we come together to share ideas, get inspired and develop our skills. Now in it’s fifth year, UXCamp boasts an eclectic mix of talks and discussions from seasoned UX’ers and novices alike; for anyone interested in user experience design, information architecture, usability and more. There are no set talks, nor any product pitches; the content of the day is shaped by all those who attend, anyone can hold a talk or host a discussion. 
				</p>
				<h1>Where and When</h1>
				<p>
				This year, UXCamp London is going ahead on the 31st of August and is taking place at Central Foundation Boys School in Old Street, London. Educating students for 150 years, it is an ideal setting for knowledge sharing. The day will start at 11am and end at 6pm.

				<h1>Who is it for?</h1>
				<p>
				UXCamp London is for anyone at all who is interested in User Experience. UXCamp has been host to a broad selection of attendees including seasoned UX practitioners who want to connect with other members of the field and trade ideas, designers and developers who want to learn more about another aspect of creating great products and services &amp; students who want to be more involved in the community and develop their skills.
				</p>

				<h1>Tickets</h1>
				<p>We have found that there is a high demand for tickets when they are released. We feel that it is better to release the tickets in batches rather than all at once so everyone has a fair chance to get one!</p>
				<p>There will be five batches of tickets released in the coming weeks:
				Batch One: Monday the 24th of June at 1PM
				Batch Two: Monday the 1st of July at 1PM
				Batch Three: Monday the 7th of July at 1PM
				Batch Four: Monday the 15th of July at 1PM
				</p>

				<h1>What is a BarCamp?</h1>
				<p>Unlike a traditional conference, a BarCamp is an event which is shaped by the attendees. Rather than having a day of scheduled speakers, you are given the opportunity to present yourself. The goal is to share what you know, learn from others and ignite discussion.</p>

				<h3>The Rules of UXCamp</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>You do talk about UXCamp London</li>
					<li>You do blog about UXCamp London</li>
					<li>If you want to present, you just write your topic in an available slot on the timetable at the event.</li>
					<li>Get involved! We want everyone who attends to participate, whether thats giving a talk, having discussions or asking questions, it's up to you.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>You create the schedule: at the start of the day anyone who wants to has the opportunity to sign up for a speaking slot. What you want to talk about is up to you! Previous sessions have been anything from “Live Wireframing” and “From post-its to personas” to “Visual Note Taking” and “A Hitchhikers guide to Gamification”.
				</p>

				

				<h1>How can you get involved?</h1>
				<p>BarCamps are a community effort and there are ways in which you can get yourself involved with UXCamp London 2013. Apart from signing up to do a talk or encouraging others to do so, you can help us with the following.
				</p>
				<h2>Sponsorship</h2>
				<p>UXCamp London is a non-profit event, run by volunteers who give their time to organise the event and run it on the day. By providing the event with sponsorship you will help contribute to the costs of venue hire and any miscellaneous costs such as materials to present the talks (pens, paper, whiteboards).
				</p>

				<p>If you choose to sponsor UXCamp, your brand will be exposed to the leading members of the industry. You will feature prominently in front of our delegates as well as being promoted to a wider audience in all of our conference material including the UXCampLondon website, EventBrite &amp; Lanyrd page, posters at the event, all email correspondence between us and attendees and tweets from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/uxcamplondon">@uxcamplondon</a> account.
