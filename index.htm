				<h1 class="heading-icon who">UXCamp London</h1>
				<p>UXCamp London is a BarCamp focused on exploring user experience, where we come together to share ideas, get inspired and develop our skills. Now in it’s fifth year, UXCamp boasts a eclectic mix of talks and discussions from seasoned UX’ers and novices alike; for anyone interested in user experience design, information architecture, usability and more. There are no set talks, nor any product pitches; the content of the day is shaped by all those who attend, anyone can hold a talk or host a discussion.

				<h1>What is a BarCamp?</h1>
				<p>Unlike a traditional conference, a BarCamp is an event which is shaped by the attendees. Rather than having a day of scheduled speakers, you are given the opportunity to present yourself. The goal is to share what you know, learn from others and ignite discussion.</p>
				<p>You create the schedule: at the start of the day anyone who wants to has the opportunity to sign up for a speaking slot. What you want to talk about is up to you! Previous sessions have been anything from “Live Wireframing” and “From post-its to personas” to “Visual Note Taking” and “A Hitchhikers guide to Gamification”.
				</p>

				<h1>Who is it for?</h1>
				<p>
				UXCamp London is for anyone at all who is interested in User Experience. UXCamp has been host to a broad selection of attendees including seasoned UX practitioners who want to connect with other members of the field and trade ideas, designers and developers who want to learn more about another aspect of creating great products and services &amp; students who want to be more involved in the community and develop their skills.
				</p>
				<h1>How can you get involved?</h1>
				<p>BarCamps are a community effort and there are ways in which you can get yourself involved with UXCamp London 2013. Apart from signing up to do a talk or encouraging others to do so, you can help us with the following:
				</p>
				<h2>Sponsorship</h2>
				<p>UXCampLondon is a non-profit event, run by volunteers who give their time to organise the event and run it on the day. By providing the event with sponsorship you will help contribute to the costs of venue hire and any miscellaneous costs such as materials to present the talks (pens, paper, whiteboards).
