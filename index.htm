				<p>Traditionally, UX Camp London is a once-a-year affair. But after this years event, we found it so awesome that we couldn't bare to wait a whole year for the next one. <strong>We've decided to do UX Camp twice a year!</strong> Join us for our spring edition in early 2014.</p>

				<p>UXCamp London is a BarCamp focused on exploring user experience, where we come together to share ideas, get inspired and develop our skills. Now in it’s fifth year, UXCamp boasts an eclectic mix of talks and discussions from seasoned UX’ers and novices alike; for anyone interested in user experience design, information architecture, usability and more. There are no set talks, nor any product pitches; the content of the day is shaped by all those who attend, anyone can hold a talk or host a discussion. </p>

				<p>At UX Camp London, there will be 10 classrooms to book for your talk at any one time and over ten time-slots in which to present in; that's over 100 possible sessions! Each session is 25 minutes; this includes your presentation and any Q&amp;A's. If you'd like to have a longer session, you are welcome to book a successive slot if possible. </p>
				</p>
				<h1>Where and When</h1>
				<p>
				The next UXCamp London is going ahead on the <strong>Saturday the 22nd of March 2014</strong> and is taking place at Central Foundation Boys School in Old Street, London.

				<h1>On the day</h1>
				<p>
				Once you arrive at UXCamp London you can to present a session. Each session slot lasts 25 minutes.
			    </p>



				<p>
				We can provide you with pens, papers and whiteboards for your talk. There will be an internet connection you can access but we recommend that you do not rely on it to present your session. There should be a projector available in each classroom for you to use.
				</p>

				<p>
				In terms of refreshments, <a target="_blank" href="http://giddyupcoffee.co.uk/">Giddy Up Coffee</a> will be on hand all day to provide you with some fantastic coffee and
				<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/MacMetCheese">When Mac Met Cheese</a> will be serving a variety of tasty mac & cheese dishes.
-->
				<h1>Who is it for?</h1>
				<p>
				UXCamp London is for anyone at all who is interested in User Experience. UXCamp has been host to a broad selection of attendees including seasoned UX practitioners who want to connect with other members of the field and trade ideas, designers and developers who want to learn more about another aspect of creating great products and services &amp; students who want to be more involved in the community and develop their skills.
				</p>

				<h1>Something for the kids</h1>
				<p>
				We know it can be hard to arrange childcare when wanting to go to an event, particularly for a weekend event like UX Camp London. Although we already welcome children to the event if they'd like to come, we wanted to organise something fun for them to do.
				</p>
				<h2>Code Club at UX Camp London</h2>
				<p>
				Code Club is an initiative to get children coding by helping them to make a variety of projects like computer games and websites. So far over 1600 primary schools in the UK host a Code Club and with their recent global expansion that number is set to increase. If you'd like to find out more about Code Club, visit their <a href="http://www.codeclub.org.uk">official website</a>.

				<p class="codeclub">
					<img src="images/codeclub.png"/>
				</p>

				<p>
				With the help of some great volunteers, we're going to be doing an all-day session of Code Club at UX Camp London. Though Code Club is usually provided as a series of weekly sessions, we'll be working through all sessions of the curriculum.
				</p>

				<p>
				Our Code Club workshop is <strong>suitable for ages 8-12</strong>. If you'd like to sign your child up for our Code Club activities, look below and grab a Code Club ticket! Please make sure that they bring a laptop (either Windows or Mac are fine).
				</p>

				<h2>Screen Printing</h2>

				<p>Drop in to our screen printing workshop on the day and learn how to print stencils on notebooks!</p>

				<h1>Tickets</h1>
				<p>We have found that there is a high demand for tickets when they are released. We feel that it is better to release the tickets in batches rather than all at once so everyone has a fair chance to get one!</p>
				<p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Batch One:</strong> Wednesday the 13th of November at 1PM</li>
				  <li><strong>Batch Two:</strong> Wednesday the 20th of November at 1PM</li>
					<li><strong>Batch Three:</strong> Wednesday the 27th of November at 1PM</li>
					<li><strong>Batch Four:</strong> Thursday the 6th of March at 1PM</li>
				</ol>

				<h1>What is a BarCamp?</h1>
				<p>Unlike a traditional conference, a BarCamp is an event which is shaped by the attendees. Rather than having a day of scheduled speakers, you are given the opportunity to present yourself. The goal is to share what you know, learn from others and ignite discussion.</p>

				<h3>The Rules of UXCamp</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>You do talk about UXCamp London</li>
					<li>You do blog about UXCamp London</li>
					<li>If you want to present, you just write your topic in an available slot on the timetable at the event.</li>
					<li>Get involved! We want everyone who attends to participate, whether thats giving a talk, having discussions or asking questions, it's up to you.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>You create the schedule: at the start of the day anyone who wants to has the opportunity to sign up for a speaking slot. What you want to talk about is up to you! Previous sessions have been anything from “Live Wireframing” and “From post-its to personas” to “Visual Note Taking” and “A Hitchhikers guide to Gamification”.
				</p>


				<h1>How can you get involved?</h1>
				<p>BarCamps are a community effort and there are ways in which you can get yourself involved with UXCamp London. Apart from signing up to do a talk or encouraging others to do so, you can help us with the following.
				</p>
				<h2>Sponsorship</h2>
				<p>UXCamp London is a non-profit event, run by volunteers who give their time to organise the event and run it on the day. By providing the event with sponsorship you will help contribute to the costs of venue hire and any miscellaneous costs such as materials to present the talks (pens, paper, whiteboards).
				</p>

				<p>If you choose to sponsor UXCamp, your brand will be exposed to the leading members of the industry. You will feature prominently in front of our delegates as well as being promoted to a wider audience in all of our conference material including the UXCampLondon website, EventBrite &amp; Lanyrd page, posters at the event, all email correspondence between us and attendees and tweets from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/uxcamplondon">@uxcamplondon</a> account.
				</p>

				</p>
				<h2>Volunteering</h2>
